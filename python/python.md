Python Notes

Classes

- named in camel case
- example declaration:
    class Car:
        pass
- constructor is def __init__(self):
- create methods by defining functions within a class
- __str__ method lets you print out objects with a self defined string


Encapsulation
- if data within an object is only used through the methods within the object, the internal integrity is guaranteed. this is called encapsulation
