# Intro to MongoDB

MongoDB is a document database - a type of nonrelational (NoSQL) database that is designed to store and query data as JSON-like documents.

In the backend, documents are stored in BSON, a binary representation of JSON. The documents themselves are comprised of field and value pairs
