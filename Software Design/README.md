# Design-Patterns

This is where I keep my notes on design patterns.

From Wikipedia,

"A software design pattern is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design. ... It is a description or template for how to solve a problem"

There are three pattern types:
- creational: patterns that create objects, rather than having to instantiate objects directly
- structual: explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, use inheritance
- behavioral: concerned with communication between objects
