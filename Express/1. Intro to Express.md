# Intro to Express

- official website: http://expressjs.com/
- is a web framework for Node.js
- install it with npm install express --save
- to use it, import it and store the express "application" into a variable
```
const express = require('express') // this is a function that creates the express application
const app = express()
```

- in a web server, we want to define routes for resources so users can perform common HTTP actions on them (GET, POST, DELETE, etc)
- we can define routes by using app.METHOD(), more details in the routing notes

Common app methods:

- app.listen(PORT, callback)
    - binds and listens for connections on the specified port
    - this enables the server functionality as the code can listen for requests
- app.METHOD() (i.e. app.post, app.put, app.get, app.delete)
    - routes an HTTP request
    - want them to end with a response method so the client will receieve a response
        - res.json(), res.send(), res.end(), etc
- app.use([path], callback)
