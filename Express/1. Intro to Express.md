# Intro to Express

- official website: http://expressjs.com/
- is a web framework for Node.js
- install it with npm install express --save
- to use it, import it and store the express "application" into a variable
```
const express = require('express') // this is a function that creates the express application
const app = express()
```

- in a web server, we want to define routes for resources so users can perform common HTTP actions on them (GET, POST, DELETE, etc)
- we can define routes by using app.METHOD(), more details in the routing notes

Common app methods:

- app.listen(PORT, callback)
    - binds and listens for connections on the specified port
    - this enables the server functionality as the code can listen for requests
- app.METHOD() (i.e. app.post, app.put, app.get, app.delete)
    - routes an HTTP request
    - want them to end with a response method so the client will receieve a response
        - res.json(), res.send(), res.end(), etc
- app.use([path], callback)
    - allows you to add on middleware - functions that perform specific tasks like convert requests to JSON, or perform logging
        - express.json is a built in middleware that parses JSON data in a request into a JS object and attaches it to the body property of the request object

<b>Router</b>

It is possible to group route handlers for a particular part of a site together and access them using a common route-prefix. For example, a baseball team's roster can have all the roster related routes in one file and have them accessed with the route prefix /roster/. This is achieved with the express.Router.

```
// roster.js - Roster route module

const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();

// Home page route
router.get('/', function(req, res) {
  res.send('Roster home page');
});

// About page route
router.get('/BobJenkins', function(req, res) {
  res.send('About Bob Jenkins');
});

module.exports = router;

```

Then the router can be used in the main app file by requiring it and adding it to the middleware handling.

```
const roster = require('./roster.js');

app.use('/roster', roster);
```
