# State and Props

<h2>Props</h2>

- the way to pass functions, state, etc to other components

Example of passing props:

```
function Welcome(props) {
    return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>
}

function App() {
    return (
        <div>
            <Welcome name="Sara" />
            <Welcome name="Collie" />
            <Welcome name="Maddy" />
        </div>
    );
}
```
The above example has a Welcome component that has one property "name" passed in as props.

- props are read only, cannot modify props

<h2>State</h2>

- state is what is used to handle values that can change over time
- state should be treated as immutable and never changed directly. Only with the setState method.
- state can be passed in props

Example declaration in a <b>class</b> component:

```
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class App extends Component {
  constructor() {
    super();

    this.state = {
      count: 0,
    };

    this.countUp = this.countUp.bind(this);
  }

  countUp() {
    this.setState({
      count: this.state.count + 1,
    });
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <button onClick={this.countUp}>Click Me!</button>
        <p>{this.state.count}</p>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```
In a <b>class</b> component the state is declared in the constructor of a class component. The setState method is used to modify the state.
