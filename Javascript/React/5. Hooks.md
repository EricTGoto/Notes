# Hooks

General Tips:
- don't call hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions
    - always use hooks at the top level of React functions

<h2>useState</h2>
- a component's memory

<b>Usage:</b>

const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);

useState returns an array with exactly two items: state variable and a function to set the state variable (setter function)
