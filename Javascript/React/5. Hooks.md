# Hooks

General Tips:
- don't call hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions
    - always use hooks at the top level of React functions

<h2>useState</h2>
- a component's memory

<b>Usage:</b>

const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);

useState returns an array with exactly two items: state variable and a function to set the state variable (setter function). The state variable must be treated as immutable and only changed with the setter function. When the setter function updates the state variable, it will invoke React to trigger a render. This is why not using the setter function will cause bugs as the UI will not update as the setter function is not invoking a render.  Setting state only changes it for the next render. If you want to change the state multiple times in a setter function, use an updater function. e.g. setCount(prevCount => prevCount ...do stuff)

Refer to notes in 2. State and Props for updating arrays/objects in state.
