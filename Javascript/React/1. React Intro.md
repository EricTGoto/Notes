# React Intro

<h2>Components</h2>
React revolves around using reusable "components".

It is good to be thinking about dividing your project into small, reusable components. In the picture above there could be many components:
- App
- NavBar
- MainArticle
- NewsletterForm

Each component is defined in an ES6 module, which can be used with the import statement. 

i.e. ``` import ExampleComponent from "./components/ExampleComponent"```

There are two ways of defining components in React: class and function based components.

Example of class based component:

```
import React, { Component } from 'react'

class App extends Component {
    constructor() {
        super()
    }

    {/* Javascript functions can be written here */}

    render() {
        return (
            <div className="App">
            Hello World!
            </div>
        )
    }
}

export default App
```

Some notes about the above:
- "extends Component" gives the App class methods and properties every React component should have
- {/* */} in React, comments must have curly braces around them, to use a double // you must:
```
{
    // comment
}
```
- render() returns JSX. JSX is HTML-like syntax that is transpiled into JS. Can't use JS protected words in the html attributes like class, onchange. Instead use className, onChange, etc.
- every render function can only return one top level JSX element
- export to be able to reuse the App component
- to use JSX, import React from 'react'

Example functional component:

```
import React from 'react';

function App() {
  return <div className="App">Hello World!</div>;
}

// OR (arrow-function syntax)

const App = () => {
  return <div className="App">Hello World!</div>;
};

// OR (implicit return)

const App = () => <div className="App">Hello World!</div>;

export default App;
```

Notes: 
- don't need extend, constructor or render for functional components
- both functional and class based components must start with a capital letter (PascalCase)
- compose components together by adding components in with <ComponentName/>


<h2>Styling Components</h2>

Style components by using className and referring to a css class like in normal html.

<h2>create-react-app</h2>

Good reference: https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started

- sets up a React application for you
- run: npx create-react-app \<app-name>

<h3>Index.js and App.js</h3>

- two of the most important files create-react-app makes
    - index.js is the entry point of the application by default

<h3>Styles and Images in CRA</h3>

Put styles into styles.css (it follows webpack guidelines) in the src folder.

Put images into the src folder and import as a variable and use that as a reference instead of linking directly to the image. This helps create a better link during the bundling process.

Instead of:
```
<img src="../images/icon.jpg">
```

Do:

```
import icon from "../images/icon.jpg"

<img src={icon}>
```
