# Lifecycle methods

- special methods build into React, used to operate on components throughout their duration in the DOM
    - e.g. when component mounds, renders, updates, or unmounts
- can only be used in class components

An example of a lifecycle of a component is:
- creation of the component (comopnentDidMount)
- render of the component (render)
- update of the component (componentDidUpdate)
- death of the component (componentWillUnmount)

There are many more and they have associated lifecycle methods.
