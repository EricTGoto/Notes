# Handle Inputs and Render Lists

<h2>Forms</h2>

In react, the standard way to handle forms is to use a technique called "controlled components". This involves having a React component maintain the value of an input with React state. (The React state drives what the user sees). The key to controlled components is setting the input's value attribute to the state value. We also want to update the state everytime there is a change. This is sometimes referred to as React state being the "single source of truth". And we can do this by having an onChange listener in the DOM element. 

Example (from react docs):

```
class NameForm extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {value: ''};
    this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);
    this.handleSubmit = this.handleSubmit.bind(this);
  }

  handleChange(event) {    this.setState({value: event.target.value});  }
  handleSubmit(event) {
    alert('A name was submitted: ' + this.state.value);
    event.preventDefault();
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>        <label>
          Name:
          <input type="text" value={this.state.value} onChange={this.handleChange} />        </label>
        <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
      </form>
    );
  }
}
```
Here we can see that everytime the input's value changes, we update the state.

<h3>Keeping track of multiple inputs</h3>
An initial naive way of keeping track of multiple inputs' state would be to declare multiple states, one for each input.

e.g.
```
const [firstName, setFirstName] = React.useState("");
const [lastName, setLastName] = React.useState("");

function Form() {
    return (
        <form>
            <input
                type="text"
                placeholder="First Name"
                onChange={handleChange}
            />
            <input
                type="text"
                placeholder="Last Name"
                onChange={handleChange}
            />
    )
}
```
But this method is not DRY (don't repeat yourself) and will become hard to manage over time. Instead, we can use an object and set a name attribute in the input.

```
const [formData, setFormData] = React.useState(
    {firstName: "", lastName: ""}
)

function Form() {

    function handleChange(event) {
        setFormData(prevFormData => {
            return {
                ...prevFormData,
                [event.target.name]: event.target.value
            }
        })
    }

    return (
        <form>
            <input
                type="text"
                placeholder="First Name"
                onChange={handleChange}
                name="firstName"
                value={formData.firstName}
            />
            <input
                type="text"
                placeholder="Last Name"
                onChange={handleChange}
                name="lastName"
                value={formData.lastName}
            />
        </form>
    )
}
```

It is also not best practice to put event.target.name and event.target.value in the return directly. It is better to destructure the event and use the destructured variables.

```
function handleChange(event) {
    const {name, value} = event.target
    setFormData(prevFormData => {
        return {
            ...prevFormData,
            [name]: value
        }
    })
}
```

<h2>APIs and useEffect hook</h2>

<i>Slight aside</i> - a side effect is anything that affects something outside the scope of the function being executed, like a network request, or some API call. 
We can have side effects when interacting with APIs if we don't know the proper way. 

Examples of side effects in React are:
- localStorage
- API/Database interactions
- subscriptions ( e.g. web sockets)
- essentially anything React isn't in charge of
    - React's primary tasks are:
        1. work with DOM to render UI
        2. manage state between renders
        3. keep UI updated when state changes

```
function App() {
    const [data, setData] = React.useState({})

    fetch("https://data-api.com/people/5")
        .then(res => res.json())
        .then(data => setData(data))
}
```

At first, it may seem like this will work, but quickly you will realize that you will get an infinite loop. Fetch will grab some data, set a new state, which will cause the component to re-render. This will then cause the code to run again, resulting in fetch being called again. This behaviour is a side effect. To solve this, we use the useEffect hook.

useEffect takes in two arguments: a callback function and an optional array argument called the dependencies array. The callback function is the effect and the array controls whether or not to perform the effect based on if any of the variables in the array have changed. By putting an effect in useEffect, we guarantee that it will run after the DOM renders. 

useEffect can return a function which is used for cleaning up.

If we want to use async inside of useEffect instead of using promises (like fetch api), create an async function inside useEffect and call it.
